abstract = {The European Society of Radiology (ESR) informs its membership and its associated Institutional Members about the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU,) which will apply from 25 May 2018. Radiologists and radiology departments should be prepared to comply with several new rules for the protection of imaging data. Although the new GDPR applies to all domains of the public and private sectors, some specific derogations are defined for data concerning health, aiming at protecting the rights of data subjects and confidentiality of their personal health data, whilst preserving the benefits of processing data, including digital images for research and public health purposes. Specific new obligations which healthcare providers (including radiologists/radiology departments) should prepare for include data access for patients, rules for data processing including explicit consent of the data subject in the absence of derogations, or technical and organisational safeguards. National health authorities can define exceptions and derogations from certain obligations by means of national law. They will also define sanctions in the form of penalties or fines that may be applicable for organisations of the public and private sector that fail to comply with the rules of the GDPR. MAIN MESSAGES • Explicit consent prior to data processing will be necessary. • Explicit consent prior to communication of imaging data will be necessary. • Providing patient access to their personal data, including portability, will be required. • Certain derogations and exceptions exist for healthcare and research. • Additional specific rules may be defined by national law.},

@article{Markiewicz2016,
abstract = {In this technical note we propose a rapid and scalable software solution for the processing of PET list-mode data, which allows the efficient integration of list mode data processing into the workflow of image reconstruction and analysis. All processing is performed on the graphics processing unit (GPU), making use of streamed and concurrent kernel execution together with data transfers between disk and CPU memory as well as CPU and GPU memory. This approach leads to fast generation of multiple bootstrap realisations, and when combined with fast image reconstruction and analysis, it enables assessment of uncertainties of any image statistic and of any component of the image generation process (e.g. random correction, image processing) within reasonable time frames (e.g. within five minutes per realisation). This is of particular value when handling complex chains of image generation and processing. The software outputs the following: (1) estimate of expected random event data for noise reduction; (2) dynamic prompt and random sinograms of span-1 and span-11 and (3) variance estimates based on multiple bootstrap realisations of (1) and (2) assuming reasonable count levels for acceptable accuracy. In addition, the software produces statistics and visualisations for immediate quality control and crude motion detection, such as: (1) count rate curves; (2) centre of mass plots of the radiodistribution for motion detection; 3) video of dynamic projection views for fast visual list-mode skimming and inspection; (4) full normalisation factor sinograms. To demonstrate the software, we present an example of the above processing for fast uncertainty estimation of regional SUVR (standard uptake value ratio) calculation for a single PET scan of F-18-florbetapir using the Siemens Biograph mMR scanner.},

@article{Keereman2010,
abstract = {One of the challenges in PET/MRI is the derivation of an attenu-ation map to correct the PET image for attenuation. Different methods have been suggested for deriving the attenuation map from an MR image. Because the low signal intensity of cor-tical bone on images acquired with conventional MRI sequences makes it difficult to detect this tissue type, these methods rely on some sort of anatomic precondition to predict the attenuation map, raising the question of whether these methods will be us-able in the clinic when patients may exhibit anatomic abnormal-ities. Methods: We propose the use of the transverse relaxation rate, derived from images acquired with an ultrashort echo time sequence to classify the voxels into 1 of 3 tissue classes (bone, soft tissue, or air), without making any assumptions on patient anatomy. Each voxel is assigned a linear attenuation coefficient corresponding to its tissue class. A reference CT scan is used to determine the voxel-by-voxel accuracy of the proposed method. The overall accuracy of the MRI-based attenuation correction is evaluated using a method that takes into account the nonlocal ef-fects of attenuation correction. Results: As a proof of concept, the head of a pig was used as a phantom for imaging. The new method yielded a correct tissue classification in 90{\%} of the vox-els. Five human brain PET/CT and MRI datasets were also pro-cessed, yielding slightly worse voxel-by-voxel performance, compared to a CT-derived attenuation map. The PET datasets were reconstructed using the segmented MRI attenuation map derived with the new method, and the resulting images were compared with segmented CT-based attenuation correction. An average error of around 5{\%} was found in the brain. Conclusion: The feasibility of using the transverse relaxation rate map derived from ultrashort echo time MR images for the estimation of the at-tenuation map was shown on phantom and clinical brain data. The results indicate that the new method, compared with CT-based attenuation correction, yields clinically acceptable errors. The proposed method does not make any assumptions about patient anatomy and could therefore also be used in cases in which anatomic abnormalities are present.},

@misc{Robson2003,
abstract = {The background underpinning the clinical use of ultra-short echo-time (UTE) pulse sequences for imaging tissues or tissue components with short T2s is reviewed. Tissues properties are discussed , and tissues are divided into those with a majority of short T2 relaxation components and those with a minority. Features of the basic physics relevant to UTE imaging are described including the fact that when the radiofrequency pulse duration is of the order T2, rotation of tissue magnetization into the transverse plane is incomplete. Consequences of the broad line-width of short T2 components are also discussed including their partial saturation by off-resonance fat suppression pulses as well as multislice and multiecho imaging. The need for rapid data acquisition of the order T2 is explained. The basic UTE pulse sequence with its half excitation pulse and radial imaging from the center of k-space is described together with options that suppress fat and/or long T2 components. Image interpretation is discussed. Clinical features of the imaging of cortical bone, tendons, ligaments, menisci, and periosteum as well as brain, liver, and spine are illustrated. Short T2 components in all of these tissues may show high signals. Possible future developments are outlined as are technical limitations.},
