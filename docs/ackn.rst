This project is being developed at University College London (`UCL <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/>`_) at the department of `Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medphys>`_ and the Centre for Medical Image Computing (`CMIC <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/>`_). Initially, it was supported and funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (`EPSRC <https://epsrc.ukri.org/>`_) of the United Kingdom (UK).  Currently, the project is being further developed under the following funding streams:

1. The `Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 <https://www.imi.europa.eu/about-imi>`_ Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 115952. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Unionâ€™s `Horizon 2020 <https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/>`_ research and innovation programme and `EFPIA <https://www.efpia.eu/>`_.

2. The `Dementias Platform UK <https://www.dementiasplatform.uk/>`_ `MR-PET Partnership <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR%2FN025792%2F1>`_, supported by the Medical Research Council (`MRC <https://mrc.ukri.org/>`_) in the UK.

I gratefully acknowledge the support of `NVIDIA Corporation <https://www.nvidia.com>`_  with the donation of the Tesla K20 and Titan X Pascal GPUs used for this research and work.
