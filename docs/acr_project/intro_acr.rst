Introduction

A phantom-imaging platform, composed of a collection of software tools, for a novel automated and high precision imaging of the American College of Radiology (ACR) PET phantom for PET/MR and PET/CT systems is presented in the next sections.

The key aspect of the analysis is quantitative measurement of the spatial resolution using the measured knife-edge response :math:`K(x)`, for any phantom insert with different attenuation and activity properties, and thus facilitating comprehensive and quantitative characterisation of PET/MR or (PET/CT) scanners in multisite clinical studies, e.g., in the `Dementias Platform UK <https://www.dementiasplatform.uk/>`_ network.
