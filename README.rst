*NiftyPET* is a software platform and a Python namespace package encompassing sub-packages for high-throughput PET image reconstruction, manipulation, processing and analysis with high quantitative accuracy and precision.  See below for the description of the above image, reconstructed using *NiftyPET* [*]_.  

*NiftyPET* includes two packages:

  * ``nimpa``:  https://github.com/pjmark/NIMPA (neuro-image manipulation, processing and analysis)
  * ``nipet``:  https://github.com/pjmark/NIPET (quantitative PET neuro-image reconstruction)

The core routines are written in CUDA C and embedded in Python C extensions.  The scientific aspects of this software platform are covered in two open-access publications:

* *NiftyPET: a High-throughput Software Platform for High Quantitative Accuracy and Precision PET Imaging and Analysis* Neuroinformatics (2018) 16:95. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-017-9352-y

* *Rapid processing of PET list-mode data for efficient uncertainty estimation and data analysis* Physics in Medicine & Biology (2016). https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/13/N322

Although, *NiftyPET* is dedicated to high-throughput image reconstruction and analysis of brain images, it can equally well be used for *whole body imaging*.  Strong emphasis is put on the data, which are acquired using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR), especially using the hybrid and simultaneous PET/MR scanners.  

This software platform covers the entire processing pipeline, from the raw list-mode (LM) PET data through to the final image statistic of interest (e.g., regional SUV), including LM bootstrapping and multiple independent reconstructions to facilitate voxel-wise estimation of uncertainties.


.. [*] The above dynamic transaxial and coronal images show the activity of  :sup:`18`\ F-florbetapir during the one-hour dynamic acquisition.  Note that the signal in the brain white matter dominates over the signal in the grey matter towards the end of the acquisition, which is a typical presentation of a negative amyloid beta (Abeta) scan.
